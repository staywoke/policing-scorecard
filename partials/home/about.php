      About This Scorecard
    </h1>
    <p>
      <strong>This is the first statewide Police Scorecard in the United States.</strong> It was built using data from open source projects, public records requests, national databases and media reports.

    <p>
      <strong>Use this Scorecard to identify issues within police departments that require the most urgent interventions and hold officials accountable for implementing solutions.</strong> For example, cities with higher rates of misdemeanor arrests could benefit most from solutions that create alternatives to policing and arrest for these offenses. In cities where police make fewer arrests overall but use more force when making arrests, communities could benefit significantly from policies designed to <a href="http://useofforceproject.org/" target="_blank">limit police use force</a>. And cities where complaints of police misconduct are rarely ruled in favor of civilians could benefit from creating an oversight structure to independently investigate these complaints.

            <strong>Advocacy Tip:</strong>&nbsp; New deadly force laws go into effect in January - requiring departments to adopt more restrictive deadly force policies. Tell your <?= ($type === 'sheriff') ? 'Sheriff' : 'Mayor and Police Chief' ?> to adopt a policy that explicitly requires police to exhaust all available alternatives prior to using deadly force.&nbsp; <a href="http://useofforceproject.org/s/Use-of-Force-Study.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>Research</strong></a> shows this policy saves lives.
