    "policy_language_has_use_of_force_continuum": "980 FORCE\nTo effectively bring an incident under control, it is the policy of this department that officers shall use only objectively reasonable force, given the facts and circumstances known at the\ntime of the event. \"Reasonable\" as applied to the use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene at the time of the incident.\nCalifornia Penal Code 835a provides that: Any peace officer who has reasonable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has committed a public offense may use reasonable force to affect the arrest, to prevent escape or to overcome resistance. A peace officer who makes, or attempts to make, an arrest need not retreat or desist from his efforts by reason of resistance or threatened resistance of the person being arrested; nor shall such officer be deemed an aggressor or lose his right to self-defense by the use of reasonable force to effect the arrest or to\nprevent escape or to overcome resistance.....\nWhile various levels of force exist, each officer is expected to respond with only that level of force which reasonably appears appropriate under the circumstances at the time to\nsuccessfully accomplish the legitimate law enforcement purpose in accordance with this policy. The decision to use force rests with each officer. While there is no way to specify the exact\namount or type of reasonable force to be applied in any situation, each officer is expected to use these guidelines to make such decisions in a professional, impartial and safe manner.\n1260 LESS LETHAL MUNITIONS \n(a) An exception to this is if physical injury to the officer or others is imminent and deadly force is not justified or the circumstances have escalated to those that would require the use of deadly force. In these cases the on scene officer may take appropriate action as necessary, including firing the SIM.\n(b) Officers assigned as back up will be given specific duties prior to the use of the SIM when personnel numbers and time permit). These duties include, but are not limited to:\n2. Designated use of “deadly force\" officer to guard against a serious escalation of force endangering the lives of officers or others.\n2220.2 DISPLAY OF WEAPONS\nOfficers should not draw or display a firearm unless the circumstances create a reasonable belief that it may be necessary to use the firearm in conformance with this policy.\nUnnecessarily or prematurely drawing or exhibiting a firearm can limit an officer's alternatives in controlling a situation, may create unnecessary anxiety on the part of citizens, and may result in\nan unwarranted or accidental discharge of the firearm. Therefore, an officer's decision to draw or exhibit a firearm should be based on the tactical situation and the officer's reasonable belief that there is a potential risk that the situation may escalate to the point where deadly force may be justified.\n2220.1 THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE\nAn officer is authorized, but not required, to use deadly force when it appears reasonable:\n(a) To protect himself or others from what he reasonably believes to be an immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury.\n(b) To prevent the escape and affect the arrest of a felon where the officer has reasonable cause to believe the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily injury to\nhimself or others.",

It must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight\nThe reasonableness inquiry in an excessive-force case is an objective one: whether the officers’ actions are objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them, without regard to their underlying intent or motivation.\n• Necessary:\nOfficers will use physical force only when no reasonably effective alternative appears to exist, and only then to the degree which is reasonable to effect a lawful purpose.\n• Proportional:\nThe level of force applied must reflect the totality of circumstances surrounding the situation, including the presence of imminent danger to officers or others. Proportional force does not require officers to use the same type or amount of force as the subject. The more immediate the threat and the more likely that the threat will result in death or serious physical injury, the greater the level of force that may be objectively reasonable and necessary to counter it.\n• De-escalation:\nTaking action to stabilize the situation and reduce the immediacy of the threat so that more time, options, and resources are available to resolve the situation. The goal of de-escalation is to gain the voluntary compliance of subjects, when feasible, and thereby reduce or eliminate the necessity to use physical force.\n• De-escalation Techniques:\nActions used by officers, when safe and without compromising law-enforcement priorities, which seek to minimize the likelihood of the need to use force during an incident, and increase the likelihood of gaining voluntary compliance from a subject.\n• When safe, under the totality of the circumstances and time and circumstances permit, officers shall use de-escalation tactics in order to reduce the need for force.\nDe-escalation tactics and techniques are actions used by officers, when safe and without compromising law enforcement priorities, which that seek to minimize the likelihood of the need to use force during an incident and increase the likelihood of voluntary compliance.

The reporting of misconduct and prevention of the escalation of misconduct are areas that demand an employee to exercise courage, integrity, and decisiveness. Department Manual Section 3/813.05 requires that when an employee, at any level, becomes aware of possible misconduct by another member of this Department, the employee shall immediately report the incident to a supervisor or directly to Internal Affairs Group. Furthermore, an employee who observes serious misconduct shall take appropriate action to cause the misconduct to immediately cease. The fact that a supervisor is present and not taking appropriate action to stop the misconduct does not relieve other employees present from this obligation.\n  \n  An employee's obligation to report and prevent misconduct begins the moment the employee becomes a member of the Los Angeles. Police officers, because of their status as peace officers, have an even greater responsibility to report and prevent misconduct. Experience, rank, or tenure are not factors in knowing the difference between right and wrong, and they do not provide an excuse for failing to take appropriate action. Although supervisors are responsible for investigating allegations of misconduct, all Department employees are responsible for preventing and reporting misconduct.\n  \n  The citizens of Los Angeles expect and deserve employees who possess a high degree of integrity. Any employee who is perceived, justifiably or not, to be condoning or concealing misconduct impairs the trust of the public. Employees must respect and be aware of their responsibility to freely and truthfully report all acts of misconduct and to act, if necessary, to prevent the escalation of those acts. This is essential if the Department is to maintain the trust of the public.\n  See: http://www.lapdonline.org/lapd_manual/volume_1.htm",
