For  example, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of the  following:\n 1. The person has a weapon or is attempting to access one and it is reasonable to  believe the person intends to use it against the officer or another.\n 2. The person is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death without a weapon  and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to do so.\"\n300.3  USE OF FORCE Officers shall use only that amount of force that reasonably appears necessary given the facts and circumstances perceived by the officer at the time of the eventto accomplish a legitimate law enforcement purpose.",
