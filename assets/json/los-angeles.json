The reporting of misconduct and prevention of the escalation of misconduct are areas that demand an employee to exercise courage, integrity, and decisiveness. Department Manual Section 3/813.05 requires that when an employee, at any level, becomes aware of possible misconduct by another member of this Department, the employee shall immediately report the incident to a supervisor or directly to Internal Affairs Group. Furthermore, an employee who observes serious misconduct shall take appropriate action to cause the misconduct to immediately cease. The fact that a supervisor is present and not taking appropriate action to stop the misconduct does not relieve other employees present from this obligation.\n  \n  An employee's obligation to report and prevent misconduct begins the moment the employee becomes a member of the Los Angeles. Police officers, because of their status as peace officers, have an even greater responsibility to report and prevent misconduct. Experience, rank, or tenure are not factors in knowing the difference between right and wrong, and they do not provide an excuse for failing to take appropriate action. Although supervisors are responsible for investigating allegations of misconduct, all Department employees are responsible for preventing and reporting misconduct.\n  \n  The citizens of Los Angeles expect and deserve employees who possess a high degree of integrity. Any employee who is perceived, justifiably or not, to be condoning or concealing misconduct impairs the trust of the public. Employees must respect and be aware of their responsibility to freely and truthfully report all acts of misconduct and to act, if necessary, to prevent the escalation of those acts. This is essential if the Department is to maintain the trust of the public.\n  See: http://www.lapdonline.org/lapd_manual/volume_1.htm",
