            How We Collected the Data
          </h2>

          <p>The California Police Scorecard integrates data on police deadly force, civilian complaints and arrests that were obtained from official databases including the California Department of Justice’s OpenJustice database, FBI Uniform Crime Report database and the California Monthly Arrests and Citation Register. Data on police “less lethal” force incidents were obtained directly from police agencies via public records requests.</p>

          <h3 class="title">
            Deadly Force Incidents
          </h3>

          <p><a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/government-code/gov-sect-12525-2.html" target="_blank">Government Code section 12525.2</a> mandates law enforcement agencies in California to report annually on all:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>incidents involving the shooting of a civilian by a police officer.</li>
            <li>incidents involving the shooting of a police officer by a civilian.</li>
            <li>incident in which the use of force by a police officer against a civilian results in serious bodily injury or death.</li>
            <li>incidents in which use of force by a civilian against a police officer results in serious bodily injury or death.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>The two years of data currently available under this reporting program, 2016 and 2017, were combined for the purposes of this analysis. To evaluate levels of police violence specifically, we excluded the small proportion of incidents where police did not use a firearm against a civilian or where police did not use another type of force causing the death or serious injury of a civilian (for example, incidents where a civilian received only minor injuries from police use of force or where a firearm was used against a police officer but not a civilian). In total, 1,341 deadly force incidents ended up being included in our analysis.</p>

          <h3 class="title">
            Less Lethal Force
          </h3>

          <p>To obtain information on serious police use of force that did not rise to the level of deadly force, we submitted public records requests to the 100 largest municipal police agencies in California asking for the total number of use of force incidents, by type of force used, in 2016 and 2017. The police departments who sent us this data varied in how they categorized and reported the use of force. For example, some police departments required officers to report all uses of weaponless force against a civilian, while others only require this type of force to be reported when it causes injury. Similarly, some departments report force used per officer while others use incident-based reporting that combines uses of force by one or more officers in an incident.</p>

          <p>Given these reporting inconsistencies, we limited our analysis to the types of force that were consistently reported and standardized the way they were categorized by each agency. Our analysis focused on uses of “less lethal” force such as tasers, batons, impact projectiles, OC spray and the carotid neck restraint. Then, data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics 2013 LEMAS survey was used to determine whether each agency in the sample used officer- or incident-based reporting (in that survey they asked each agency whether they use incident-based reporting, officer-based reporting, or both to report force). To ensure consistency between the two reporting systems, we obtained individualized use of force data from agencies that did report on an incident basis and determined the number of use of force incidents by grouping officer-based use of force reports by time and location. Altogether, we were able to calculate and compare incidents of less lethal force for 25 of the 100 largest CA police departments.</p>

          <h3 class="title">
            Civilian Complaints
          </h3>

          <p>State and local law enforcement agencies provide the California Department of Justice with Citizens' Complaints Against Peace Officers (CCAPO) data through an annual summary. The information includes the number of criminal and non-criminal complaints reported by citizens, racial and identity profiling complaints and the findings from investigations into those complaints. In addition to these categories of complaints, we also submitted public records requests to the 100 largest municipal police agencies in California asking for the total number of use of force complaints and the number of those complaints that were sustained (i.e. upheld by investigators).</p>

          <h3 class="title">
            Arrests
          </h3>

          <p>Data on the number and demographics of each agency’s arrests in 2016 were obtained from the California Monthly Arrests and Citation Register (MACR). This dataset classified arrests by whether the offense was a misdemeanor, felony or juvenile arrest. Since juvenile arrests were not disaggregated by felony or misdemeanor offense type, we excluded juvenile arrests (which comprised a small proportion of overall arrests) from the analysis. In one case, for San Francisco, we obtained data directly from the agency because they did not report data to the MACR in a format consistent with other departments (they did not disaggregate arrests of Hispanic individuals from White, Black, Asian and Other racial categories). Finally, we obtained data on the number of murders and murders cleared from 2013-2017 from the FBI Uniform Crime Report database.</p>


          <h3 class="title">
            How We Calculated Agency Scores and Grades:
          </h3>

          <p>The scores or “grades” attributed to police agencies in our analysis incorporate a range of policing-related indicators designed to evaluate how these agencies interact with, and the extent to which they are accountable to, the communities they serve. Each police agency’s grade should be interpreted as a relative score, showing how each agency compares to other agencies within the state across three areas of policing: police violence, police accountability, and an evaluation of each agency’s approach to policing (for example, the extent to which an agency focuses on arresting people for low-level offenses or solving serious crimes).</p>

          <p>These scores are not intended to provide an exact accounting of the quality of every aspect of policing within a jurisdiction, but rather to provide data that can provide insight into how a police department has performed across a range of issues of considerable public concern compared to other police departments within the state.</p>

          <h3 class="title">
            Here are the factors that were used to calculate each agency’s score:
          </h3>

          <h3 class="title">
            Police Violence Score:
          </h3>

          <p>The police violence score takes into account how often police used higher levels of force against people including any time police used a firearm, taser, baton, OC spray, impact projectile or stranglehold on a civilian. Since the vast majority of use of force incidents occurred during an arrest, consistent with <a href="http://policingequity.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/CPE_SoJ_Race-Arrests-UoF_2016-07-08-1130.pdf" target="_blank">previous research</a> we benchmarked use of force incidents against the number of arrests made and then factored in the severity of force used and whether the people force was used against were armed, to calculate each police department’s police violence score.</p>

          <h3 class="title">
            Police Accountability Score
          </h3>

          <p>The police accountability score evaluates the extent to which investigations into civilian complaints of police misconduct result in a sustained finding of misconduct against the officers involved, which is usually the first step to imposing disciplinary consequences. The score accounts for both how police departments compare with one another in terms of their civilian complaint sustain rate, the overall proportion of complaints sustained, and the severity of the misconduct allegations that were sustained against officers (for example, complaints alleging police committed a criminal offense were weighted more heavily than vs non-criminal allegations).</p>

          <h3 class="title">
            Approach to Policing Score
          </h3>

          <p>The approach to policing score evaluates the extent to which police departments focus on arresting people for low-level offenses or focusing on solving serious crimes. The score accounts for the proportion of the most serious crimes - murder - that an agency solves as well as how each agency compares in terms of its approach to the lowest level offenses, measured by misdemeanor arrest rates per population. Misdemeanor arrest rates per population have been cited in <a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2473&context=journal_articles" target="_blank">previous research</a> as an effective measure of whether a department has adopted a “ broken windows” or “zero tolerance” policing approach.</p>

          <h3 class="title">
            Review of Police Department Policies and Police Union Contracts
          </h3>

          <p>In addition to collecting data on police outcomes (use of force, accountability, arrests), this project also includes information on public policies that have been shown in the research literature to impact these outcomes. While the quality of a police department’s policies were not one of the factors used to calculate their score, this information was collected to provide greater insight into the ways in which policies and systems either encourage or discourage police violence and accountability.</p>

          <p>Specifically, the full policy manual and police union contract of each police agency was obtained and reviewed to identify the extent to which they contained language that either restricted the use of force or that imposed barriers to investigating and holding police accountable for misconduct. <a href="http://useofforceproject.org/s/Use-of-Force-Study.pdf" target="_blank">Previous research</a> has shown a significant link between the restrictiveness of a police department’s use of force policy and rates of police violence per arrest. Moreover, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3246419" target="_blank">research</a> shows the categories of policy provisions we identified within police union contracts to be associated with higher levels of police abuse and police killings of unarmed civilians. For more information on the methodology used to review these policies, visit Campaign Zero’s <a href="http://useofforceproject.org" target="_blank">Police Use of Force</a> project and <a href="http://checkthepolice.org" target="_blank">Police Union Contract</a> project. We also reviewed the statewide Law Enforcement Officer Bill of Rights law and included the barriers to accountability within this law that impact every agency within the state.</p>

          <h3 class="title">
            Additional Data:
          </h3>

          <p>This project continues to collect additional data on policing in California, including data on police stops and searches, police personnel, civil asset forfeiture, issues occurring in police custody, police militarization, police discipline and other issues. These data will be released and integrated into the scoring system in the coming months. If you have information or ideas to improve our database, email us at sam@thisisthemovement.org.<p>
