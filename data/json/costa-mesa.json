A peace officer who makes, or attempts to make, an arrest need not retreat or desist from his efforts by reason of resistance or threatened resistance of the person being arrested; nor shall such officer be deemed an aggressor or lose his right to self-defense by the use of reasonable force to effect the arrest or to\nprevent escape or to overcome resistance.....\nWhile various levels of force exist, each officer is expected to respond with only that level of force which reasonably appears appropriate under the circumstances at the time to\nsuccessfully accomplish the legitimate law enforcement purpose in accordance with this policy. The decision to use force rests with each officer. While there is no way to specify the exact\namount or type of reasonable force to be applied in any situation, each officer is expected to use these guidelines to make such decisions in a professional, impartial and safe manner.\n1260 LESS LETHAL MUNITIONS \n(a) An exception to this is if physical injury to the officer or others is imminent and deadly force is not justified or the circumstances have escalated to those that would require the use of deadly force.

Therefore, an officer's decision to draw or exhibit a firearm should be based on the tactical situation and the officer's reasonable belief that there is a potential risk that the situation may escalate to the point where deadly force may be justified.\n2220.1 THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE\nAn officer is authorized, but not required, to use deadly force when it appears reasonable:\n(a) To protect himself or others from what he reasonably believes to be an immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury.\n(b) To prevent the escape and affect the arrest of a felon where the officer has reasonable cause to believe the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily injury to\nhimself or others.","link_to_policy_manual":"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1b6CbUMJFux0SDB9FDWX8VtYwCoUVVXD3\/view \nhttps:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1W16PoXMmUERW0xw4DLS4r9W176IphfdR","percent_asianpacificislander_deadly_force":null,"percent_white_deadly_force":null,"percent_black_deadly_force":null,"percent_hispanic_deadly_force":null,"percent_other_deadly_force":null,"percent_asianpacificislander_population":"11%","percent_white_population":"50%","percent_black_population":"2%","percent_hispanic_population":"36%","percent_other_population":"2%","percent_asianpacificislander_arrests":"4%","percent_white_arrests":"59%","percent_black_arrests":"6%","percent_hispanic_arrests":"28%","percent_other_arrests":"4%","people_perceived_to_have_gun":null,"people_found_to_have_gun":null,"percentile_of_murders_solved":"3%"}
